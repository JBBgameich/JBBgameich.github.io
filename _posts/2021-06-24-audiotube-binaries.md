This is good news for all of you that have been asking for AudioTube binaries.
A nightly flatpak build is now built regularly on KDE's binary factory.
The [community wiki](https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Flatpak) explains how to install from the nightly repository.

In the meantime I have been working on getting AudioTube through KDEReview, which is going nicely so far. It should soon get stable releases as part of Plasma Mobile Gear.
