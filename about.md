I'm a hoby photographer in an early stage (you can't find any of my pictures here yet), Debian packager (currently at Halium), currently inactive Minetest modder and texturepack maker, and RISC-V fanboy (since yesterday, today is the 3rd of October 2017). Debian is my operating system for years now, and I don't think I'll leave it anytime soon.

My biggest dream (in the FOSS world), is being able to run Plasma Mobile as everyday OS on my phone, so I'm contributing to Halium a little bit. I worked on improving the Plasma Mobile packaging to work on Debian and Ubuntu for the last weeks, and everything seems to work now.
