I'm a programmer, hobby photographer, Debian packager, currently inactive Minetest modder and texturepack maker and interested in embedded and mobile devices development.

Currently I'm an active member of the Plasma Mobile community.

Debian is my operating system for years now, and I don't think I'll change it anytime soon.
